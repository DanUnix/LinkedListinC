Linked List Data Structure Practice

Basic Singly Linked List.

Each Cell consist of an integer element and a pointer to the next Cell.

lookup function: Takes an integer parameter and compares it to each value in the list recursively. If TRUE then returns 1 else return 0.

insert function: Takes an integer parameter and recursively inserts that element at the tail of the list.

delete function: Takes an integer parameter and compares it with each element in the list. If the element is in the list then recursively delete that element from the list. 

display function: Display all values in the list.

display_recursive: Dispaly all values in the list using recursion.

main function: Test the functions on a newly created list per execution time.
